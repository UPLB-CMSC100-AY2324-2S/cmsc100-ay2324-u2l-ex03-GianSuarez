Simulating a password validation program in Javascript </br>

While doing this exercise, I applied a combination of syntax we covered in our lab sessions and some additional syntax that I found on W3Schools. </br>

Key Takeaways: This exercise isn't easy because it needs different kinds of syntax. And since I'm not good at remembering them all, it stresses me out. </br>
